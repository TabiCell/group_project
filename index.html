<p>
<strong>  law </strong><br/>
/lɔː/<br/>
noun<br/>
1.the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.
"shooting the birds is against the law"

Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate
 behavior.[2] It has been defined both as "the science of justice" and "the art of justice".[3][4]
 Law regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state.
 State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator,
resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by
judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create
legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative
arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a
constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics,
history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

  I don’t want a dog with a J.D.,<br/>
  What use would that be to me?<br/>
  <br/>
  Fido is good at catching a ball,<br/>
  But he cannot practice law.<br/>
  <br/>
  I need a lawyer to free me from jail,<br/>
  Not one that chases his own tail.<br/>
  <br/>
  I desire a lawyer able in the law,<br/>
  Not one that fancies a tennis ball.<br/>
  <br/>
  Bottom line, I need a lawyer, dawg,<br/>
  But I do not need a lawyer dog.<br/>
